## Argonne MUSIC Detector
For more information on the MUSIC detector, see [Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A 799, 197 (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2015.07.030) about the use of MUSIC with radioactive beams, and see [Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A 859, 63 (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.03.060) to learn more about the use of MUSIC to measure ($\alpha$,p) and ($\alpha$,n) reactions.
